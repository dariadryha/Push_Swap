# Push_Swap

This project is about sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions.

The project consists of two parts:
* *checker*: takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output.
* *push_swap*: calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest progam using Push_swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.
